Hey,

**We need Analytics to improve our app**. However, **most analytics** (Like Google Analytics) **aren&#8217;t yet fully prepared for Single Page Apps (SPA)**. Google Analytics tracks page views once your browser refreshes the page, which in old pages meant changing the URL. **Now, with AngularJS, we never refresh the page**. We have a complete WebApp which changes URLs, changes resources, but never does a refresh. So, the question isÂ **how can we track page views and events now?**

**That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve created Angularytics**. Angularytics makes it easy to track page views and events. For now, it works with a console logger and with Google Analytics.

**In order to configure this to automatically track page views, all you need to do is the following:**

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mgonto/5703159.js"></script>

**Withi this, every time the URL changes in your SPA, Google is going to track this page view. Just 5 lines of code and you have this working in your SPA.**

****Now, if you want to track events, you can do this by either using the trackEvent filter or the Angularytics service. **The track event method signature is the same as the one in Google Analytics and <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/eventTrackerGuide" target="_blank">can be checked by clicking here</a>**

**Let&#8217;s see how we can use the filter**. Imagine we want to track an event when a user clicks on certain button that actually calls a function in the scope.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mgonto/5703172.js"></script>

Pretty easy, right?

Now, let&#8217;s see how we can do this in a service:

This is it :). **What do you think about this? I&#8217;d love your feedback :).**
