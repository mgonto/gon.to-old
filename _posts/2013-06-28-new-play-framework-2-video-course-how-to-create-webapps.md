**[TL;DR: I&#8217;ve created a new Play Framework Video Course. Please click here to check it out.][1]  
**

Hey,

I know there&#8217;re a lot of people trying to learn Play Framework 2, as they want a nicer and easier Java or Scala framework than using Spring MVC, JSP, Servlets and so on.

This is why I&#8217;ve created jointly with PacktPub editorial a Play Framework 2 video course. In this course, you&#8217;ll learn how to create a WebApplication and you&#8217;ll learn it with a lot of examples and comparison. You&#8217;ll also learn how to create and consume REST APIs, how to secure your app, how to use Twitter Bootstrap and much much more.

After finishing the course you&#8217;ll be able to create your own app. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me.

I hope you enjoy it. **[To check it out, please click here.][1]**
